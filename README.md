just testing an AI wrapper. the RizzGPT is a lost concept and actually uses AI to give a summary in about 50 words of a topic you give it.

what i learned in this:
- using python to create a server to host my own GPT on.
- gave me understanding on very basic HTML to implement this into a website.
- more indepth knowledge of how AIs work.
